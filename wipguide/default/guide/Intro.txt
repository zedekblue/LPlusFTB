If you're reading this, you're either very bored, or very lost on what to do.
I've decided to write up a small quick-start for anyone new to ftb, as well as highlight a few of Genesis's best features.


If you're completely new to ftb, jump into -Starting Out
If you've played before, but new to many of the mods, check out -Progression
If you're a veteran, but lacking motivation or guidance, check out -Endgame
